# Project: Testing Practice

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

 1. A <br>capitalize</br> function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
 2. A <br>reverseString</br> function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
 3. A <br>calculator</br> object that contains functions for the basic operations: <br>add</br>, <br>subtract</br>, <br>divide</br>, and <br>multiply</br>. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
 4. A <br>caesarCipher</br> function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
