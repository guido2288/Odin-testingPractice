# Project: Testing Practice

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

 1. A <strong>capitalize</strong> function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
 2. A <strong>reverseString</strong> function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
 3. A <strong>calculator</strong> object that contains functions for the basic operations: <strong>add</strong>, <strong>subtract</strong>, <strong>divide</strong>, and <strong>multiply</strong>. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
 4. A <strong>caesarCipher</strong> function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
